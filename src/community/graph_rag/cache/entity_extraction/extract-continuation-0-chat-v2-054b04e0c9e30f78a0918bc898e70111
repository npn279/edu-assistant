Chúng ta dự đoán rằng kết quả classification cho cơ sở dữ liệu này sẽ tương đối cao.\nTách training và test sets\nGiả sử chúng ta muốn dùng 50 điểm dữ liệu cho test set, 100 điểm còn lại cho training set. Scikit-learn có một hàm số cho phép chúng ta ngẫu nhiên lựa chọn các điểm này, như sau:\nfrom sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split\nX_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(\niris_X, iris_y, test_size=50)\nprint \"Training size: %d\" %len(y_train)\nprint \"Test size    : %d\" %len(y_test)\nTraining size: 100\nTest size    : 50\nSau đây, tôi trước hết xét trường hợp đơn giản K = 1, tức là với mỗi điểm test data, ta chỉ xét 1 điểm training data gần nhất và lấy label của điểm đó để dự đoán cho điểm test này.\nclf = neighbors.KNeighborsClassifier(n_neighbors = 1, p = 2)\nclf.fit(X_train, y_train)\ny_pred = clf.predict(X_test)\nprint \"Print results for 20 test data points:\"\nprint \"Predicted labels: \", y_pred[20:40]\nprint \"Ground truth    : \", y_test[20:40]\nPrint results for first 20 test data points:\nPredicted labels:  [2 1 2 2 1 2 2 0 2 0 2 0 1 0 0 2 2 0 2 0]\nGround truth    :  [2 1 2 2 1 2 2 0 2 0 1 0 1 0 0 2 1 0 2 0]\nKết quả cho thấy label dự đoán gần giống với label thật của test data, chỉ có 2 điểm trong số 20 điểm được hiển thị có kết quả sai lệch. Ở đây chúng ta làm quen với khái niệm mới: ground truth. Một cách đơn giản, ground truth chính là nhãn/label/đầu ra thực sự của các điểm trong test data. Khái niệm này được dùng nhiều trong Machine Learning, hy vọng lần tới các bạn gặp thì sẽ nhớ ngay nó là gì.\nPhương pháp đánh giá (evaluation method)\nĐể đánh giá độ chính xác của thuật toán KNN classifier này, chúng ta xem xem có bao nhiêu điểm trong test data được dự đoán đúng. Lấy số lượng này chia cho tổng số lượng trong tập test data sẽ ra độ chính xác. Scikit-learn cung cấp hàm số accuracy_score để thực hiện công việc này.\nfrom sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score\nprint \"Accuracy of 1NN: %.2f %%\" %(100*accuracy_score(y_test, y_pred))\nAccuracy of 1NN: 94.00 %\n1NN đã cho chúng ta kết quả là 94%, không tệ!
