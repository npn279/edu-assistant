Đây chính là phương trình của một siêu mặt phẳng. Vậy Logistic Regression tạo ra boundary có dạng tuyến tính.5. Thảo luậnMột điểm cộng cho Logistic Regression so với PLA là nó không cần có giả thiết dữ liệu hai class là linearly separable. Tuy nhiên, boundary tìm được vẫn có dạng tuyến tính. Vậy nên mô hình này chỉ phù hợp với loại dữ liệu mà hai class là gần với linearly separable. Một kiểu dữ liệu mà Logistic Regression không làm việc được là dữ liệu mà\nmột class chứa các điểm nằm trong 1 vòng tròn, class kia chứa các điểm bên ngoài đường tròn đó. Kiểu dữ liệu này được gọi là phi tuyến (non-linear). Sau một vài bài nữa, tôi sẽ giới thiệu với các bạn các mô hình khác phù hợp hơn với loại dữ liệu này hơn.Một hạn chế nữa của Logistic Regression là nó yêu cầu các điểm dữ liệu được tạo ra một cáchđộc lậpvới nhau. Trên thực tế, các điểm dữ liệu có thể bịảnh hưởngbởi nhau. Ví dụ: có một nhóm ôn tập với nhau trong 4 giờ, cả nhóm đều thi đỗ (giả sử các bạn này học rất tập trung), nhưng có một sinh viên học một mình cũng trong 4 giờ thì xác suất thi đỗ thấp hơn. Mặc dù vậy, để cho đơn giản, khi xây dựng mô hình, người ta vẫn thường giả sử các điểm dữ liệu là độc lập với nhau.Khi biểu diễn theo Neural Networks, Linear Regression, PLA, và Logistic Regression có dạng như sau:Hình 8: Biểu diễn Linear Regression, PLA, và Logistic Regression theo Neural network.Nếu hàm mất mát của Logistic Regression được viết dưới dạng:\n\\[\nJ(\\mathbf{w}) = \\sum_{i=1}^N (y_i - z_i)^2\n\\]\nthì khó khăn gì sẽ xảy ra? Các bạn hãy coi đây như một bài tập nhỏ.Source code cho các ví dụ trong bài này có thểtìm thấy ở đây.6.
